# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification using K-Neighbours Classifer & Streamlit

A **machine learning web app** built with **K-Neighbours Classifier** and **Streamlit** that predicts the **species of Iris flower** based on its features such as sepal and petal dimensions.

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸŒ¼ Predicts one of three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, or *Virginica*  
- ðŸ“Š Uses a **trained K-Neighbours model** for accurate classification  
- ðŸ§  Simple, intuitive **Streamlit-based web interface**  
- ðŸ’¾ Includes model saving/loading using **joblib**

## ðŸ§© Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|------------|-------------|
| Frontend | Streamlit |
| Backend | Python |
| Machine Learning | scikit-learn |
| Model Storage | joblib |
| Dataset | Iris dataset (from scikit-learn) |

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. User inputs **sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width**  
2. Model predicts the flowerâ€™s **species**  
3. Streamlit displays the **result interactively**
